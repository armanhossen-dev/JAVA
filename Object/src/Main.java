        # in programming an objcet  can represent an real-world entity

        object = an entity that hold data (attributes), can have things
                and can perform actions (methods), can do things
                it is a reference data type
        - we store the data for object,  in a location known as heap

        lets create some car objects
        - we will need class,
            class -  A class can serve/behave as a blueprint to create objects
            'src' - 'new' - 'java class' - name it 'car' then enter
