Problem Statement (Using Abstract Class)
You are developing a University Management System where different types of people are associated with the university 
‚Äî such as students, faculty members, and staff. All of these entities share common attributes but also have their own
 specific properties.
______________________________________
üèõÔ∏è Requirements:
üîπ Common Attributes (Abstract Superclass: Person)
Each person in the university has:
‚Ä¢	name (String)
‚Ä¢	age (int)
‚Ä¢	id (String)
You must create an abstract class Person that contains:
‚Ä¢	These common attributes
‚Ä¢	An abstract method displayInfo() that must be implemented by all subclasses
______________________________________
üî∏ Specific Attributes for Subclasses:
‚Ä¢	Student
    o	studentID (String)
    o	courseEnrolled (String)
    o	grade (double)
‚Ä¢	Faculty
    o	facultyID (String)
    o	designation (String)
    o	department (String)
‚Ä¢	Staff
    o	staffID (String)
    o	role (String)
    o	shift (String)
Each subclass should:
‚Ä¢	Extend the Person abstract class
‚Ä¢	Implement the displayInfo() method to show its details
______________________________________
üß† Behavior (Methods):
‚Ä¢	Each subclass must override the displayInfo() method to display all the information, both inherited and unique.
______________________________________
‚úÖ Solution Using Java Inheritance and Abstract Class:
You must:
1.	Create an abstract class Person with common attributes and an abstract displayInfo() method.
2.	Create three subclasses: Student, Faculty, and Staff, each with their specific attributes.
3.	Implement displayInfo() in each subclass to show complete details.
